# Pokemon-Generation-1-Battle-Simulator

Basically, this is a project I decided to do since I enjoy Pokemon and coding. This is meant to emulate 
https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/. Basically, what I did was that I made a Pokemon battling simulator, where 2 people
can play with each other on the same laptop. The Pokemon permitted for use are any fully evolved Pokemon in the first 
generation of Pokemon games, and the battling mechanics are the same as on Gameboy cartridge Red, Blue, and Yellow.
It doesn't have all the features that I want it to have at this point, however, like letting people make their own movesets,
or animations in general. Instructions for how to play can be found once running the project, but in order to run the 
application, just go to game.py and run it.
